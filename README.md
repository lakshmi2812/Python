About the Repository
=====================

The files 'python_script_to_download_ieee_publications.py' and 'python_script_to_download_springer_publications.py' in the 'Selenium_with_Python' folder contain Python scripts to download all IEEE and Springer publications respectively of Prof. Lin at San Jose State University.

This was part of Voluntary work under Prof. Lin.

Selenium Web driver and 'Beautiful Soup' have been used to scrape the webpages and get the relevant data and automate the 
download of the publications.
